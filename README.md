# Predicting Diabetes in Indian Patients Using Logistic Regression

## Overview
This project builds a machine learning model using **Logistic Regression** to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on medical predictor variables from the **Pima Indians Diabetes dataset**. The dataset contains various health indicators like glucose levels, blood pressure, and BMI to help determine diabetes risk.

## Dataset Information
- **Dataset:** Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset
- **Source:** Available from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository** & **Kaggle**
- **Features:**
  - Pregnancies
  - Glucose
  - Blood Pressure
  - Skin Thickness
  - Insulin
  - BMI
  - Diabetes Pedigree Function
  - Age
- **Target Variable:** Diabetes outcome (1 = Positive, 0 = Negative)

## Objective
The goal of this project is to:
- Develop a predictive model using **Logistic Regression**.
- Preprocess and analyze the dataset for meaningful insights.
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.
- Provide a structured workflow for medical predictions.

## Tools & Libraries Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** 
  - `pandas` - Data handling
  - `numpy` - Numerical operations
  - `sklearn` - Machine learning model development
  - `matplotlib/seaborn` - Data visualization

## Key Findings
- Feature scaling improves model accuracy.
- Imbalanced classes affect predictive performance.
- Regularization helps optimize the Logistic Regression model.
- ROC-AUC and F1-score provide valuable insights into model reliability.
